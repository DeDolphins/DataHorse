Hello DataHorse Team,

I would like to suggest two features to improve DataHorse:

1- Automated Data Cleaning: Implement an automated data cleaning feature that prompts users with questions about handling missing values or duplicates upon uploading datasets.
2- AI Assistant Integration: Integrate an AI assistant to provide real-time support, answer queries, and guide users through data analysis tasks.
If you find these ideas helpful, I would love to collaborate further and kindly request you to accept my pull request.

Thank you!

Best,
Rajesh
